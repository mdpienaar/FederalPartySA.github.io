        <h2>Demand for FPSA</h2>
        
          <p>South Africa has 11 official languages in one multicultural "territory". Some languages/cultures are wronged
          because of "the Unity", which is not reality.</p>
          
          <p>"A Multi culture society is best served in a federal dispensation where culturally distinct regions
          govern themselves to the highest possible degree. This prevents the dominant culture overpowering smaller
          cultural groups." <a href="https://twitter.com/Jimboymil/status/1268914766262816769" target="blank">(@Jimboymil on Twitter)</a>
          Within the constraints set by the SA Constitution, decentralised regional governance "to the highest possible degree"
          is the policy.</p>
          
          <p>
            The Left and Right will be divided, the foreseeable future, but can be a united party. Apartheid included a bad idea
            (segregation), which originated long before apartheid. The mistake of apartheid was segregation, not self-determination.
          </p>
        
           <p>Willing self-determination, is one objective, in different forms, all have in common.
           Every-one willing it, however, does not promote others' self-determination. Promoting own and others' self-determination,
           is necessary for peaceful unity, as opposed to despotic "Unity".
           FPSA is a post-1994 South African party, in touch with the complicated reality, with solutions to solve the
           problems of current times.</p>
           
           <p>FPSA's objective is to unite the left and right in one party, whilst arranging self-determination for all in
           multicultural (left) and unicultural (right) regions. It is basically the current proposal, but the short constitution
           allows other proposals.</p>
           
           <p>The current self-determination parties on the right, represents primarily one minority group and cannot draw enough votes,
           to trump the imperialism of the majority parties on the left. FPSA can draw more than 50% of the votes, because FPSA represents
           all groups for self-determination.
           Imperialism is represented on the left by the African
           National Congress, Democratic Alliance and Economic Freedom Front. That does not mean, imperialism is a
           phenomenon only of the left. In Spain for example, imperialism is a phenomenon on the right, because the majority
           parties on the right do not allow self-determination to Catalonia on the left. Left politics are identified
           with policies promoting multiculturalism in one territory. Right politics promote uniculturalism in one territory.
           Imperialism can be right or left. Imperialism thus is regarded as politics,
           divided into parties representing either the left or the right, or the middle, focusing on centralized governance.
           </p>
           
           <p>Whichever party wins in imperialist politics, forces their
           policies down on all others, if they have large enough majorities. If they do not have large enough majorities,
           coalitions are formed, which implies infighting and misleading governance. FPSA changes that, with its reasoning
           against imperialism, whether it is imperialism on the left, right or middle. In South Africa the problem
           currently, is imperialism on the left, because the majority parties are fixated on the idea of controlling all
           of South Africa only for multiculturalism. FPSA promotes self-determination for multiculturalism and uniculturalism,
           against imperialism.</p>
           
           <p>Corruption is out of control and current majority parties will not fix it, because honesty is not part of the parties'
           cultures. A Deputy Chief Justice of South Africa, for example, wrote falsely in a Judicial Service Commission investigation
           conclusion report,
           he refused to sign, his view about a heterosexual man's "beliefs and homosexuality". The Public Protector refused
           to investigate the Judge's actions. It happened, partly due to different cultural "convictions" and beliefs, regarding
           honesty. It was one of the most important reasons FPSA was founded, because different cultural views about honesty, cause
           different levels of corruption. Corruption is currently destroying 100s of years' work in South Africa, and sometimes
           people cannot work honestly, because the legal system does not protect isolated honest individuals, who are always weak,
           against groups. Truth with its relation to honesty, is a very important idea of
           <a href="https://africahead.github.io/Africahead/Intequinism.html"
             target="_blank">Intequinism</a>, the foundation of FPSA.
           Deceiving groups control South Africa with criminal activities. The big difference among cultures with
           regard to the interaction between "the-individual" and "the-group", is one of the most indicative problems necessitating
           more than one cultural system/region in South Africa, because it influences creativity, development and sustainability.</p>
           
           <p>FPSA can draw more than 50% of the votes for self-determination of all, because anyone from any group of
           any folk, as well as multiculturalists, of the South Africa nation, can vote for FPSA. To comprehend better how this
           can be done, please read on.</p>

        <h2>Membership of FPSA</h2>
        
        <p>FPSA does not have members who pay recurring membership fees, because voting is a private matter. Ordinary members buy DiP tokens
        or pay R100.
        The names of ordinary members are not currently registered. Not having a membership list, means FPSA does not have annuity income.
        The exchange of DiP tokens for fiat money and cryptocurrencies must partly fund FPSA.</p>
        <p>Executive membership should be purchased, to also fund FPSA. Executive membership gives the right to make proposals and attend and vote on
        General Meetings. Executive Members are also members of Houses in FPSA. Executive Membership can be inherited according to
        the constitution of FPSA "similar" to the House of Lords membership in the United Kingdom. More information is available further down at
        <a href="#ExecutiveBody(EB)">"Executive Body (EB) of FPSA"</a>,

        <p id="PoliticalTheory"><a href="#PageContents">Page Contents</a></p>
        <h2>Political Theory</h2>
        <p><em>Most people have a will to self-determination in common, but most people have been indoctrinated with
        the idea of "Unity", which relates to "Self" and despotism, hindering others' self-determination.</em></p>
        
        <p>Politics changed from Imperialism into Democratic Imperialism (DI), which will change to Democratic Self-Determination (DSD).
        DI is identified primarily with majorities of the left, the middle and the right and coalitions.
        According to politics about DSD the primary choice is between imperialism and self-determination. The primary
        choice is not between left and right. All political parties can thus be divided between imperialist and self-determination parties.
        Imperialist parties place too much importance on centralised governance and "Self", without considering others. FPSA promotes balance
        between centralised and decentralised governance, prioritising self-determination of all, with decentralised governance.</p>
        
        <p>Political orientation can be plotted on a Matrix of Politics. FPSA represents all, for
        their self-determination. The reality is, each language, represents different groups, left and right, therefore, on the
        way to self-determination of individuals each, sub groups of each language should first attain self-determination.
        Self-determination of each individual implies all people, must respect universal laws, otherwise others'
        self-determination is not respected.</p>
        <p><b>Matrix of Politics:</b><br>
            X - Axis: Liberal (-6) to Conservative (+6)<br>
            Y - Axis: Unity (-3) to Self-Determination (+3)</p>

           <p id="Reasonstovote"><a href="#PageContents">Page Contents</a></p>
           <h2>Reasons to vote for FPSA</h2>
           <p>A primary decision of voters, is, choosing between only multiculturalism in one "United" South Africa, or,
           self-determination of each group. It is two mutually exclusive conditions due to 
             cultural dynamics. Multiculturalist culture, has rights 
             to self-determination in multicultural regions. Multiculturalists, however, should not have the right to claim all the 
             territory in South Africa for their control. There need thus be a balance between democratic 
             rule and self-determination of powerless groups. Being "United" with a capital "U" is a fallacy,
              because despotic Leviathan governments are "the sovereign" of "United" territories. That is
            partly why democracy came into being. Imperialism and being "United" are similar. The phenomenon is 
             present at communist, socialist and capitalist thinking. True 
             "democracy" will respect self-determination of groups each. FPSA
              is the only party, drawing votes from all 
             South African groups, for self-determination of groups and individuals each.
              Any person believing in self-determination for all, can 
             vote for FPSA. Choosing multiculturalism in South Africa, implies
              rejecting own language development, in favour of English. Uniculturalism in other languages than English
              does not accept such degradation of own culture, therefore the system should change to allow uniculturalism
              in other languages than English.
              </p>
            
               <p>Striving for fallacious "Unity", caused the 2nd World War. Germany was too diverse to be one 
            "United" state. Multiculturalism, is currently causing much friction in the USA and Europe, like 
            before the 2nd World War, because imperialist democracy gives majority culture, central governance of it "all". 
            South Africans have been indoctrinated with the "Union", which is multicultural, 
             since after the Anglo-Boer War. The same that happened before 1994 is busy happening again. Because
             of imperialist selfish reasons, it was not and is not comprehended; it is impossible for a central government,
             without sufficient decentralisation, to consider all cultures for self-determination. The 
             ruling dominant group cannot consider other groups sufficiently, because cultures are 
             too different. It is unavoidable that cultural convictions will be forced down on minorities. 
             Before colonisation, Africa was divided into language groups, like most of Europe is currently.
               </p>
               
               <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantons_of_Switzerland" target="_blank">Switzerland</a>
             has policies closest to how FPSA promotes self-determination currently. The 
             territorial units there are becoming smaller. The last secession happened recently, without 
             war. Switzerland is currently divided into 26 cantons. Some are German, some are French, one 
             is Italian and some are multicultural (French, German, Italian and Romansh). Uncolonised places
             tend to structure themselves into unicultural and multicultural 
             groups. It often however, happens after wars. A modern phenomenon, for example, in the European
              Union, is, "citizens" own property among other language speakers.
           </p>
           <p>FPSA promotes self-determination for all, unless it infringes on the rights of others' 
             self-determination. The universal idea Love, the root of social contract theory and criminal law; not-doing evil
             to all others like selves do not want evil done to, is relevant, when self-determination of all is considered.</p>
           <p>FPSA can draw votes for the idea self-determination from all groups of South-Africa, including the multicultural group,
           because of a constitution, supporting all groups, with different policies, convictions and 
             beliefs. It is not necessary for all leaders of FPSA to agree. The only policy to agree about 
            is self-determination for all groups, which implies mutual respect.</p>
           <p>The objective to divide and share one state, according to acceptable criteria, for self-determination of all
              groups, is simple and clearly distinct from fallacious "Unity", which makes the whole South Africa multilingual and effectively
              English.
               It will depend on negotiations in the future, instead of possible war. FPSA turns the clock back to before 
              1994 for a renegotiated dispensation, retrospectively taking new information and new realisations into consideration.</p>
             <p>Each group will determine their own economic, legal, education and other policies, in the right balance with
             central governance, therefore 
               the decision to vote for FPSA, during 2021, does not depend on those things. A vote will be
                primarily for the idea self-determination. More detail will be published in the future. 
                The only South Africans who will not have a House in FPSA, are the ones who convict in imperialist "Unity" of all territory,
                as opposed to self-determination.</p>

                 <h2>Priorities</h2>
                 
                 <p>* Votes: Anyone wanting to contest upcoming <a href="DiP/Byelections.html" target="_blank">by-elections</a>
                 or 2021 local elections, as councillors, on behalf of FPSA, should contact FPSA. Councillors have much freedom
                 to make own policy, left or right, in their regions.</p>
                 
                 <p>* Funding: If funding is not forthcoming soon, FPSA, may close down. FPSA is not
                 funded by big business or wealthy individuals, like most parties, therefore every little donation helps.
                 A funding model is used whereby tax deductible tokens can be bought
                 and traded, on <a href="https://africahead.github.io/Africahead/IppartsExchange.html"

           <p id="ExecutiveBody(EB)"><a href="#PageContents">Page Contents</a></p>
           <h2>Executive Body (EB) of FPSA</h2>
           <p>The EB consists of individuals, who have seats on the Executive Body. The seats can be purchased, sold and inherited. An
           amount to buy a new seat is not fixed. The amounts will change according to circumstances.
           The EB are not a group, representing a specific
           part of society. A group would have lapsed again into imperialist fallaciousness, like groups usually do. The EB divide themselves
           into different Houses, but on General Meetings they vote as Party, each seat representing one vote. If a House does not
           exist where an executive member is comfortable, new Houses can be formed. Self-determination of all groups is protected in the
           Constitution of FPSA and the Constitution of FPSA may not change, except for clarification.
           </p>
           <p>The EB must arrange self-determination for all wanting it, "locally", with the
           knowledge and trust, self-determination of others, is respected nationally and internationally. Self-determination starts locally
           if a national or international justice system does not uphold self-determination rights of individuals each, as is happening currently.</p>
           
           <p id="Leadership"><a href="#PageContents">Page Contents</a></p>
           <h2>Leadership of FPSA</h2>
           <p>FPSA promotes the leadership of regions by "monarchs", who respect self-determination for all groups, according to section
           143 of the SA Constitution. Separate Constitutions for each province will say more about that.</p>
           <p>
           The way the leadership must develop, is, influential representatives of all the different groups of all the folks of the
           South Africa nation, must come forward and fill and form different Houses, representing different groups, in FPSA. It will be beneficial
           if these leaders can be people with much influence, and people with
           good ideas, who can draw many votes, and do fundraising well, from all the different groups. New EB members must also help fund FPSA,
           whilst buying seats on the EB. Leadership has two parts, which are rarely found in the same person.
           Having good ideas is a result of honesty. Often however, honest people are not very influential and social.
           Influential leaders communicate good ideas, to others, and do networking. There will thus be two types of leaders in FPSA.
           Honest leaders, will probably be active in the background with well-known leaders communicating policy to voters. Preferably, all the
           Houses must have both types of leaders.</p>
           
           <p id="Policy"><a href="#PageContents">Page Contents</a></p>
           <h2>Current Proposed Policy of FPSA</h2>
           <h3>General Policy</h3>
           <p>Self-determination is a democratic internationally 
             accepted right, which opposes imperialist democracy, based on left and right politics.
             The attainment of the right in a peaceful way will be more 
             likely if different groups work together in one party to oppose imperialism, the major enemy
             of self-determination. Acceptable dividing
            criteria exist, and if the criteria are respected, people from different backgrounds can divide
             themselves in a peaceful united way and attain self-determination. Previously, division and 
             consequential self-determination came
              into being via wars, which are
              unacceptable imperialist ways. Logically that is why the right to self-determination must be attained with
            democratic majorities. Switzerland is an example for the world, with regard to this, because 
          recently, secession there caused the 26th canton, without war. Switzerland made the choice against
           imperialism 100s of years ago, whilst dividing the Swiss nation into unicultural and multicultural
           cantons.</p>
           <p>Different groups will be represented by FPSA, each with their own policies.</p>
           
           <h3>Land Policy</h3>
           <p>Land policy, 
             because it is the most topical, can be used to explain the policy. A <a href="DiP/various/EWCobjection.pdf"
             target="_blank">letter</a> was submitted to
             Parliament to object against the planned Expropriation Without Compensation (EWC). The policy of 
             FPSA implies, South Africa must first divide into multicultural (left) and unicultural (right) regions,
             with self-determination, before further land reform takes place. If EWC takes place it must be combined
             with a resettlement program, whilst considering the likely distribution of different cultures in future. In
             principle EWC should not take place, partly because, if EWC takes place, it will be breaking the agreement,
             negotiated for the 1994 transition.
             It is however unlikely, unless the ruling party changes its policy, because all of South Africa is regarded
             as multicultural territory currently and imperialist selfishness is the order of the day. The only shared
              policy, among the leaders to be, of FPSA, is, governance of land must be divided. How the division
               will take place, and where borders will be, are 
             matters for negotiations. The division of land does not mean people will have to 
             move, if they do not want to. In Europe, for example, people can live anywhere, whilst
              governance of land is divided into unicultural and multicultural regions. 
               In Switzerland, for example, each canton decides self, which official language(s) to use.
               Before colonisation and before the 1910 "Union" of South Africa, language regions existed. 
               Since the materialist false "Union", South Africa had trouble among language groups, basically 
               because in a "Union" only one group controls all others, and a group cannot consider other 
               groups' self-determination sufficiently, because of different cultural preferences. Central governance (imperialism)
               causes problematic tribalism.
           </p>
           
           <p id="LandProposal"><b>Proposal for discussion to solve the land problem</b></p>
           <p><b>Step 1:</b> Governance is decentralized to regions where multicultural (left) and unicultural (right) groups have
           self-determination.
           <br><b>Step 2:</b> All the land in each region is valued.
           <br><b>Step 3:</b> The value of all the land is borrowed to the decentralized governments by the SARB at 0% interest.
           <br><b>Step 4:</b> The decentralized governments buy all the land or do something else with the money, each according to their culture.
           <br><b>Step 5:</b> The owners of the land decide to accept the offers or not. If they accept, they stay on and manage the land if the
           decentralized governors want that.</p>
           
             <p>A proposal in 
             FPSA, is to attach, language and belief preferences, to land. Some areas each can have only one first
              language and English as second language, whilst the laws of the region mirror the beliefs/convictions
               of the group, governing the region. Other areas can have many official languages in multicultural 
              groups. Some or all metropoles will probably be multicultural regions.</p>
             <p>Governance will become more decentralized. Culture and
                philosophy/religion have an important influence on the law and education, therefore each
                area will have an own legal and education system.
              </p>
                <p>Different Houses will form in FPSA. Probably, each House will represent a region, but 
                 how the Houses will develop, is not predetermined.</p>
              <p>A leader of FPSA may promote any policy, but the policy must align with the Constitution 
                of FPSA, to divide peacefully.</p>
                <p>The following proposed steps to determine division can be discussed.<br>
                    
                    1) Different groups based on language and/or belief/conviction/morals,
                     interested to determine their futures and record their history self, are identified. Writing of opinions,
                     by representatives of all the groups, in books and blogs on the Africahead websites will enhance
                     the FPSA communities.
                    <br>
                    2) A referendum divides the population into folks/groups.<br>
                    3) The votes are regionalised according to addresses.<br> 
                    4) Negotiations take place.<br>
                    5) Borders for decentralized governance are drawn.<br>
                    6) Assuming 3 groups among each language folk, and multiculturalist groups exist, gives reason for around 40 regions. The
                    multicultural groups will probably be situated in different metropolitan regions, because multiculturalists are
                    usually city-folk.
                </p>
                     
                     <p id="LanguageMap"><b>Language Map of South Africa</b></p>
                     
                     <p>Language, cultural and multicultural areas already exist in South Africa. The following language map
                      of South Africa, produced by Stats SA from 2011 census data, was sourced 
                      from <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:South_Africa_2011_dominant_language_map.svg" 
                      target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
                     
                <p><img src="indexfiles/LanguageMapSA.png" alt="Language map South Africa" 
                  height="263" width="300"></p>
                
                <p>Another useful map is the district municipal map of South Africa at
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_South_Africa" 
                      target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

                    <p><b>Moving is not a prerequisite for dividing a country. Division can happen only with regard 
                    to governance, without requiring movement. Most local governments are currently dysfunctional,
                     partly because of different cultures and languages represented in local governments each. Much
                     infighting will be stopped if each region is governed by only one language, cultural or multicultural group.
                      If people want to move, it can happen as time goes on, after establishing different governance regions. 
                    Changes in the short term, in most areas, will probably not be much. In the long term, adjustments in line
                    with reality, will happen gradually. FPSA therefore promotes constant gradual changes, and rejects revolutionary
                    change.</b></p>
                    
                    <h3>Defence</h3>
                    
                    <p>South Africa should have only one Defence Force. It should use defensive, not offensive ways. One of the most
                    important considerations is to what extent central governance should protect "the individual" against criminal
                    action of "the-group" regionally, because different regions could have different criminal systems. All groups do not
                    regard, for example, intimidation and crimen injuria as criminal offences. Federal Police action against criminality
                    can be combined with defence, because criminal action against a folk, could relate to attacking behavior of
                    foreigners. An historical reference is the Opium Wars of China.</p>
                    
<h3>Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>A foreign policy of FPSA, proposed for South Africans is, South Africa should have no foreign enemies and no foreign allies,
because the South Africa nation, divided into different folks, divided into different groups, cannot afford to be divided more
by foreigners. That could imply pulling out of BRICS and the United Kingdom Common Wealth, causing contradiction on national
level, dividing the nation. These types of decisions however cannot be thought about properly without being really involved.</p>
<p>South Africa is a big enough territory to be independent from foreigners, if good governance is present.</p>
<p>South Africa should be part of a well functioning international group of countries applying universal laws about not-doing
evil to all others like selves do not want evil done to. The "categorical imperative" is also referred to as criminal law and/or
social contract theory and/or universal Love.</p>

<h3>Domestic Policy</h3>
<p>One of the most important tasks will be forming a force, whose sole task will be protecting each individual
against ostracism/excommunication/outlawing, in one canton, at least. Domestic policy is simply to give each region/group/folk the
most possible self-determination within national and international context, against imperialist control of the nation.</p>

<h3>Economic Policy</h3>
<p>FPSA promotes economic independence as far as possible, for each region. The main difference between FPSA's national economic
policy and current political parties' national economic policy, is, current major parties are controlled by an international monetary
force. The result is, capital is not created in South Africa currently. Capital is primarily borrowed from abroad and invested into
South Africa by foreigners. The result is, to survive, current political parties, basically, sell South Africa to foreigners.
</p>
<p>Capital forms, basically, from two human sources; ideas and labour. Most people have conviction in the The Labour Theory of Value.
When the majority favors state control of ideas it is called socialism and communism of leftist politics. When the majority favors religious
control of ideas it is called capitalism of rightist politics. Intequity (capital of ideas) is a new word, which caused Intequinism, the
foundation of FPSA.

        <h2>Constitution of FPSA</h2>
          <p>The <a href="indexfiles/ConstitutionFPSA.pdf" 
          target="_blank">Constitution of FPSA</a> explains its primary objectives. Details were intentionally omitted to allow flexibility,
          to attain the objectives, whilst respecting self-determination of all. The objectives must be attained with negotiations among
          different groups, wanting self-determination. This webpage contains proposals, which can be opposed within FPSA, whilst
          the FPSA Constitution and SA Constitution are respected. FPSA's Constitution may not change, except for clarification.

          <p>Other Houses will be formed to include as many groups as possible, for self-determination of all.</p>
        
        
        
            
            <p id="Elections"><a href="#PageContents">Page Contents</a></p>
            <h2>Elections</h2>
            
            <p>FPSA did not take part in the 2019 general elections, but needs local candidates in all municipalities for the
            local elections of 2021 and by-elections before 2021. Refer to the <a href="DiP/Jobs.html" target="_blank">Jobs page</a>.
            </p>
            
            <h3>A Manifesto for the Local Elections of 2021 and By-Elections</h3>
            <p><b>*Divide Municipal Funds!*</b>
            <br><br>Much money has been stolen from municipalities. It was possible because of the centralized control of funds.
            If the funds of each municipality are divided into different bank accounts, it won't be possible to steal from a central bank
            account. Each ward can have their own bank account with ward councillors' signatures and another signature required, before
            payments are made for wards.</p>
            
            
            <p id="Future"><a href="#PageContents">Page Contents</a></p>
            <h2>The Future</h2>
            
            <p>Intequinism, the foundation of FPSA, and the source of the current proposal, does not prioritize achieving
            teleological ends, despotically, like imperialism. An objective to achieve, is relevant though. The objective however, will adjust
            to circumstances. Nationally, the objective is self-determination for all unicultural and multicultural groups in different
            regions (cantons), if they want it. If the policy is universalized, it means self-determination regions will become smaller,
            but central governance areas could become larger. For example, because many Zimbabweans already live and work in South Africa,
            South Africa and Zimbabwe, could become one national territory, with many self-determination regions. In such a new nation,
            the central government will be much smaller though, than any of the current central governments in South Africa or Zimbabwe,
            because most governance will be decentralized. The same idea can be extrapolated internationally. The main function of a
            central government, is seeing that the idea Love; not-doing evil to all, like selves do not want to be done to, is enforced.
            That is basically criminal justice, applied on universally acceptable terms. The International Criminal Court, already has such
            a function. Criminal justice, must however operate in conjunction with measures, preventing circumstances, which cause
            criminality.
            </p>
            <p>Promoting self-determination for all groups, wanting it, is a new political movement, because previously promoting
            self-determination, happened only for "Self", often in a violent way. Like stated above, it is foreseen, Democratic
            Imperialism (DI) will transition to Democratic Self-Determation (DSD), like monarchism transitioned to DI. Therefore
            a website was formed at <a href="SDI/index.html" target="_blank">Github</a>, where different new DSD groups and
            parties, forming internationally, can cooperate, to achieve the goal of DSD for all, willing it. Real self-determination
            can only be achieved if self-determination is promoted for all groups worldwide otherwise it is imperialism, which has
            shown itself as fallacious and selfish. The despotic "king archetype" and lying "president archetype" are not positions to
            aspire to in FPSA.</p>
